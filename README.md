Step 1: Create an AWS Lambda Function
First, we need to create an AWS Lambda function to handle the API requests. 

This function takes an event and context as input and returns a greeting message. We'll deploy this function later in Step 3.

Step 2: Create an AWS API Gateway
Next, we need to create an AWS API Gateway to act as the entry point for API requests. Here are the steps to create an API Gateway:

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway service.
Click "Create API" and choose "REST API".
Choose "New API" and enter a name for your API.
Click "Create API".
Now that we have created an API Gateway, we need to create a resource and method to handle API requests.

Click "Create Resource" and enter a name for your resource.
Click "Create Method" and choose "GET" as the HTTP method.
Select "Lambda Function" as the integration type and check "Use Lambda Proxy Integration".
Select the region where your Lambda function is located and enter the name of your Lambda function.
Click "Save".
Step 3: Deploy the API
Now, we need to deploy the API so that it can be accessed by clients. Here are the steps to deploy the API:

Select the resource and method that you created in Step 2.
Click "Actions" and choose "Deploy API".
Choose a deployment stage and click "Deploy".
Step 4: Test the API
Finally, we can test the API to ensure that it's working correctly. Here's an example of how to test the API using cURL:
Replace "your-api-gateway-url" with the URL of your API Gateway and "resource-name" with the name of the resource that you created in Step 2. This command will send a GET request with a "name" query parameter to your Lambda function and return a greeting message.

And that's it! You have now created a Serverless application in Python using AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda.
